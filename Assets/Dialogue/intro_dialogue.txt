elder: Someone please help me! My daughter, she was taken, please someone, anyone!

hero: Breathe man and tell me what happened.

elder: I heard a ripping noise from my daughters room and I ran in to check. 
elder: I found her room destroyed and her window wide open. There were claw marks everywhere. 
elder: I looked through the window and right at the tree line I saw a beastly figure retreating to the shadows of the forest. 
elder: Please you have to help my daughter! That thing took her. 
edler: I don't want to imagine what will happen if you don't get to her in time.

hero: I understand, I will gather my friends and leave right away. 
hero: However are you sure she might not already be...

elder: I don't know. There was no blood... I think... I don't know just please find her...
